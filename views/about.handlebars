    <p>
      Iâ€™d like you to build a one page application that does the following:
For a company, such as NML, to send out a question to their staff for feedback, e.g. would you like to go on a blockchain course?
The url has to be emailed out (i.e. we need a friendly url)
The application allows you to login (maybe just using your surname i.e. very basic authentication)
It allows you to read the question, then respond with yes / no or leave null
On your record you should be able to edit
The db will require a list of all employees, a questions table and an answers table.
Ideally we would want to be able to see a list of all employees with their response to the question.
